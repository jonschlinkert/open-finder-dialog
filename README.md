## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save open-finder-dialog
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { openFinderDialog } from 'open-finder-dialog';
// or
import openFinderDialog from 'open-finder-dialog';
```

## API

Signature:

```typescript
export const openFinderDialog = async (filepath?: string, terminal?: string): Promise<string>;
```

Example usage:

```ts
// Open the dialog in the current working directory
const selectedPaths = await openFinderDialog();
console.log('Selected paths:', selectedPaths);
```

Opens a Finder dialog to select files and returns the paths of selected files. You'll need to split these files into an array yourself, in case additional handling is required.

### Params

**filepath** (optional)

The initial directory where the dialog should open. Defaults to the current working directory.

```ts
const selectedPaths = await openFinderDialog('/some/file/path.txt');
```

**terminal** (optional)

Optionally specify a terminal app, so we can reliably return focus after the dialog is closed. By default, [detect-terminal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-terminal) is used when no argument is passed.

```ts
const selectedPaths = await openFinderDialog(null, 'iterm');
```
